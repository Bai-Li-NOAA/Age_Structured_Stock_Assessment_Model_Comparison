# Age-Structured Stock Assessment Model Comparison Project

We used a simulation-estimation approach to evaluate the reliability of the four primary age structured assessment models currently used by NOAA Fisheries: the Age Structured Assessment Program (ASAP), the Assessment Model for Alaska (AMAK), the Beaufort Assessment Model (BAM), and Stock Synthesis (SS).

## About the project

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) conducts annual stock assessments and provides the best scientific information available for fisheries management to the U.S. regional fishery management councils. Different regions utilize different assessment software packages, although the models share similar mathematical and statistical attributes. However, comparison studies identifying similarities and differences among different packages used in the U.S. remain scarce. We evaluated the reliability of the four primary age structured assessment models currently used by NOAA Fisheries: the Age Structured Assessment Program (ASAP), the Assessment Model for Alaska (AMAK), the Beaufort Assessment Model (BAM), and Stock Synthesis (SS). We used a simulation-estimation approach to examine any bias of parameter estimation under various model structures. 

The project is built based on [R](https://www.r-project.org/). 

## Getting started

1. Get the age-structured stock assessment packages:
 - [AMAK](https://github.com/NMFS-toolbox/AMAK.git)
 - [ASAP](https://nmfs-fish-tools.github.io/ASAP/)
 - [BAM]
 - [SS](https://vlab.ncep.noaa.gov/web/stock-synthesis/home)
2. Clone the repo

 git clone https://github.com/Bai-Li-NOAA/Age-Structured-Stock-Assessment-Model-Comparison.git
